# story_plots_challenge

Welcome to the "Story plots" challenge!

Here's a list of 112,937 plots extracted from wikipedia: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1JsORDo4i58m7z6uCpINtiixWmQWC2R-8

Your challenge is to programmatically label plots having a female protagonist. The titles of the plots are included as well. 
What we are interested in is how you approach a simple yet complex natural language processing task;
* Protagonist: The leading character in a story, play, or film, usually the hero or heroine (Oxford dictionary);
* "Female" naturally refers to female identifying person;
* There is no minimum number or percentage of plots that you must identify;
* There is also no single, true way to solve it. Many plots have multiple protagonist, many no protagonist at all;
* You can add comments in code, as notebook markdown, however you desire;
* Multiple solutions and approaches are accepted and welcomed.

Fork this repository privately and push the solution to your repo.

We look forward to be inspired by your solutions.
